## BOTS

- (Telegram) https://tgdev.io/bot/orgrobot - Makes you answer questions in DM before speaking, doesn't work with large chats as welcome message is hidden. Dev is working on a fix
- (Telegram) tgdev has a ton of good bots, all free - DrySandBox, Lang Blocker Bot, and BetaOrgRobot are worth checking out.
- (Discord) https://wickbot.com/ for captcha/permissions. Captcha.bot was compromised a few months ago and is useless. 
- (Discord) https://probot.io/ for reaction roles, may be something better to use here - but this is the best one I've found so far (There's an embed editor in browser)
